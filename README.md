My Personal Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my personal projects that are not proprietary and can be shared publicly. These projects demonstrate my skills and interests in software development, automation, and system optimization.

This repository showcases a selection of projects I've worked on, ranging from automation scripts to database optimization. These examples reflect my expertise in Python programming, Java development, and system integration. Note that some projects are shared for educational purposes and do not include proprietary or client-specific information.

Projects
Python Automation Scripts
Image-Based Task Automation: Developed scripts using PyAutoGUI, win32API, and WIN32CON to automate tasks based on screen image detection. These scripts enhance productivity by performing actions such as clicks and keystrokes based on visual cues.

Automation Example: An example Python script demonstrating the use of PyAutoGUI for detecting and interacting with screen elements.

SQL Database Optimization
Database Optimization Scripts: Python scripts to automate SQL database optimization tasks, such as indexing and query performance tuning. These scripts resulted in significant improvements in query execution times and overall database efficiency.

Sorting Algorithms: Implemented data sorting algorithms in Python to enhance database performance, streamline data retrieval, and reduce load times.

Follow Project-Specific Instructions: Each project may have its own setup and usage instructions, which can be found in the respective project directories.
